    In my first master year I took a course about computational biology. There were a lot of exercises associated with it, so I am quite proud of the code I wrote for this course.

In my first year of my master's degree I had a course on Computational Biology. Unfortunately I can't publicly host the code as the course exercises as it is not permitted to share the answers. The course handled subjects such as:

* Motif search
* Gibbs sampler
* Eularian path search
* Turnpike problem
* Alignment of sequences
* 2-break
* UPGMA

If you are interested to have a look at the code, [contact](/contact) me and we will see if we can arrange something.
