  jobtitle: Research Intern
  description: >-
    In the summer of 2018 I did my internship as part of my education. I chose to do an internship abroad to get more international experience 
    and to challenge myself by putting myself in an unfamiliar environment. The internship took place at the [University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hszg.de/en) 
    in Zittau, Germany. As an intern I did research into machine learning solutions for the monitoring of nuclear waste containers by analysing 
    the vibrations of these structures. At the end of my internship I wrote a [paper](/assets/report.pdf) about my research which will likely be 
    published in the [ACC Journal](https://acc-ern.tul.cz/en/acc-journal)
  started: July 2018
  ended: September 2018
  leveraged: Implementation was done in Python using the Keras framework.
