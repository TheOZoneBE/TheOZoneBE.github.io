    After graduating in my master computer science I decided to not immediately find a fulltime job but instead I searched for an international experience.
    I found the [European Solidarity Corps](https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity_en), a programme of the European Union that allows youths to perform a volunteership within Europe.
    I was selected to come work in the Young Innovation HUB in Åmål, Sweden.
    The Hub is a place where we help young people to furfill their personal projects, such as organizing events or starting a business.
    During my time there I helped organize a few events, did some public speaking in the schools in the area and started my own workshop [Game I/O](/projects/game-io).

    [Open Summer of Code](https://2019.summerofcode.be/) is a project where several teams of students work on real life open innovation projects. 
    This year I was assigned to the Best@ project.
    This project was issued by the Digital Transformation department of the federal government.
    The aim was to develop a toolbox of useful scripts to allow the recently published dataset of addresses in Belgium to be used more easily.
    For this we produced Python scripts that allowed to download the zipped dataset of the addresses, extract the xml files, convert them to csv and use them in other applications such as geocoders.
    An overview of our work can be found [here](https://osoc19.github.io/best/). View the [project page](/projects/best-at) for more info.

  jobtitle: Research Intern

    In the summer of 2018 I did my internship as part of my education. 
    I chose to do an internship abroad to get more international experience and to challenge myself by putting myself in an unfamiliar environment. 
    The internship took place at the [University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hszg.de/en) in Zittau, Germany. 
    As an intern I did research into machine learning solutions for the monitoring of nuclear waste containers by analysing the vibrations of these structures. 
    At the end of my internship I wrote a [paper](/assets/pdfs/zittau_report.pdf) about my research which will be published in the [ACC Journal](https://acc-ern.tul.cz/en/acc-journal) in the Summer of 2020.
